#  UNOPS – Delivered Projects

As part of my assignments for **UNOPS** (United Nations Office for Project Services), I developed several web platforms focused on **impact analysis**, **data visualisation**, **operational communication**, and **project management**.

These solutions are designed to:
- facilitate access to field data,
- improve preparedness and humanitarian response,
- disseminate geospatial analyses,
- modernise communication for IMAT and UNOSAT teams.

#  Project 1 — Hurricane Beryl: Scroll Storytelling Platform

###  Goal  
Build an interactive platform to tell the story of **Hurricane Beryl**, from pre-impact to recovery, using smooth storytelling synchronised with video and geospatial data.

---

## Overview

**Beryl Impact Scroll Storytelling** is an immersive Next.js experience that guides the user through the **before**, **during** and **after** phases of Hurricane Beryl:

- videos synchronised with scroll,  
- animated overlays,  
- configurable narrative content,  
- integration of live **StoryMaps** and **ArcGIS** dashboards,  
- end of the journey with a **downloadable PDF report**.

The experience is powered by generic components (`FullScrollSection`, `useScrollVideo`) that make it easier to precisely synchronise the page progress with the video.

---

## Features

- Story split into **3 phases** with overlays triggered from a central configuration file.  
- Immersive hero section with animated satellite imagery and scroll cue.  
- **Smooth scrolling** using Lenis + GSAP triggers.  
- Global overlay to handle transitions & preloading.  
- Direct integration of ArcGIS StoryMap + dynamic dashboards.  
- Final PDF report to extend the analysis.  
- Video preloading to guarantee stable animations.

#  Project 2 — “Portfolio Tools” Project Management Platform

###  Goal  
Develop a full-stack web application for UNOPS teams (or associated mission) to manage and showcase projects, with an admin interface and public publication.

- Image storage (cover + gallery) via Firebase Storage  
- Dynamic public pages for each project (`/project/[id]`)  
- Search, filtering, pagination, favourites  
- Dark mode & modern UI with Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons  

## Main features  
- Admin interface: create / edit / delete projects  
- Image upload (drag-and-drop, reordering)  
- Public listing: project grid with filters  
- Detailed project pages with rich descriptions and gallery  
- Auth & security: “superadmin” role and owner permissions  
- Responsive design & accessibility  

## Tech stack  
- Next.js 15+ (App Router)  
- TypeScript  
- Firebase: Authentication (Google), Firestore, Storage  
- Tailwind CSS v4  
- Lucide React Icons

#  Conclusion

These projects built for **UN / UNOPS** provide tools that are:

- more visual,  
- more narrative,  
- more accessible to decision-makers,  
- and better integrated with UNOSAT geospatial data.

They highlight my ability to work on **high-impact humanitarian projects** with strong **performance**, **reliability** and **structured storytelling** requirements.
