Building a multilingual site in Next.js (App Router) requires balancing DX, performance, and clarity. This project implements:

### Key Features

- Language segment (`/[lang]`) with static params for `en` and `fr`.
- Dictionary loader with per-language JSON files and tree-shakeable import.
- MDX content organized by language (`/content/blog/{lang}` and `/content/projects/{lang}`).
- Localized metadata + JSON-LD schema including canonical URLs.
- Theming (light/dark) with a token-based design system using OKLCH.
- Animated page transitions and reveal-on-scroll components.
- Project & blog detail pages sharing a consistent visual layout.

### Filtering Logic

Projects page uses a derived, side-effect free filtering strategy:

```ts
const filteredProjects = useMemo(
  () =>
    selected === "__all__"
      ? all
      : all.filter((p) => p.categories.includes(selected)),
  [all, selected]
);
```

This ensures the full set is always the source of truth.

### About Page

Replaces a previous Photos page with a structured, dictionary-driven mini-CV (experiences, skills, education, CV link) â€” all copy lives in `/app/[lang]/dictionaries` for ease of translation.

### Next Steps

- Expand automated tests for dictionary coverage.
- Add back/forward sync for category filter.
- Provide localized fallback images via a shared config.

If you're exploring how to internationalize a content-heavy portfolio with strong UX, this implementation is a solid, extensible baseline.
