[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F1msirius%2FNextfolio)

## Installation

Nextfolio uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for dependency management, so ensure it is installed on your system.

Execute [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to bootstrap the example:

```
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/1msirius/Nextfolio my-portfolio
```

Start the development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

Customize your Nextfolio setup by updating your information to ensure proper SEO, feed generation, Open Graph integration, and other settings.

### Sitemap

Adjust the routes to match your portfolioâ€™s navigation in **app/sitemap.ts** file for SEO optimization:

```
let routes = ["", "blog", "projects", "photos"].map((route) => ({ // Update routes according to your navbar
	url: `${BaseUrl}${route}`,
	lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0],
}));
```

### Profile Photo

Update your profile photo by replacing the **public/profile.png** file with your image.

### Favicon

Update your favicon by replacing the **public/favicon.ico** file with your custom icon.

## Analytics

Nextfolio uses [Vercel Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) and [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) to monitor user interactions and website's performance. Simply deploy your site on Vercel and enable both features through the Vercel dashboard.
