> Rather than a vague to-do list, this post lays out a realistic roadmap for my personal projects: what I want to improve, what’s on pause, what I’m preparing next… and where a possible internship abroad fits into all of this.

## 1. Context & intent

My personal projects (PascheK-ChatBox, m3ntha, the homelab, educational tools…) evolve quickly, often based on ideas and needs of the moment.  
I wanted to take a step back to:

- Clarify **where I want to go** with these projects.
- Set **priorities** (not everything has to be done _right now_).
- Think about what is a **showcase** for my portfolio (value for a recruiter/client) and what is more experimental.
- Position an **internship abroad** as a building block in this progression, not just a side episode.

This roadmap isn’t a contract, but a **direction**.

---

## 2. Main focus areas

I break my future projects into several main axes:

1. **Consolidate what already exists**  
2. **Turn m3ntha into a real product**  
3. **Structure my homelab like a “pro” infrastructure**  
4. **Connect my projects to an international experience (internship abroad)**  
5. **Launch new, focused mini-projects (open source & pedagogy)**

_(Yes, that’s five axes, but in practice they often overlap.)_

---

## 3. Consolidating existing projects

### 3.1. PascheK-ChatBox

Goal: turn PascheK-ChatBox from a “cool big side project” into a tool I can present as a **solid reference** for AI + Electron.

Possible improvements:

- Rework the UX to make it clearer (projects, sessions, files).
- Stabilise Electron packaging (macOS + Windows releases, auto-update).
- Improve the RAG module:
  - better view of indexed documents,
  - visual feedback on which chunks were used in a response.
- Add one or two “ready-to-use” demos:
  - repo analysis,
  - course material preparation,
  - long PDF summarisation.

### 3.2. History project & educational content

I want to keep some room for **educational** projects:

- Refactor the History project into a **course website template**.
- Experiment with a **note system** (Obsidian / MDX) rendered on the web.
- Document the “workflow” more thoroughly: preparation, plan, resources, etc.

---

## 4. Turning m3ntha into a product

m3ntha is currently a **CMS under construction**: custom auth, themed UI, dashboard, Stripe integration coming soon, and a proper editor.

### 4.1. “Minimum product” stage

First, I want to reach a **coherent MVP**:

- Stabilised authentication (login/signup, reset, verified email).
- Clear dashboard:
  - profile,
  - projects/sites,
  - billing.
- Stripe integration:
  - plans (free / standard / pro),
  - subscription management on the user side.

### 4.2. “Editor & deployment” stage

Then I’m aiming for a **CMS editor MVP**:

- Page editor with blocks (text, image, section, CTA).
- Site structure management (pages, menu, basic SEO).
- Connection to the backend / Docker to deploy a site from the interface.

Idea: I want m3ntha to become a **case study** of a modern full-stack setup in my portfolio.

---

## 5. Structuring my homelab like a “pro” infra

My homelab already runs on a Dell R730 with Docker, a reverse proxy, Nextcloud, WordPress, databases…

Next steps:

- Document the infra as if it were a **client project**:
  - network diagrams,
  - Docker stack diagram,
  - backup policy.
- Set up:
  - monitoring (Prometheus / Grafana or similar),
  - basic alerts (disk usage, container down).
- Start building **“Infrastructure as Code”** for the Docker part (compose + reproducible scripts).

The goal is not to build a “mini hyperscale cloud”, but a **clean, understood, reproducible** infra that I can explain in an interview.

---

## 6. New focused mini-projects

I don’t want to launch ten new products, but a few very **targeted mini-projects** that strengthen my profile:

- A small open-source **design system / UI kit** (buttons, cards, modals, themes).
- A **React utilities / hooks** package I use often (theme, modals, forms).
- An open-source **course site template** based on the History project.
- A generic public example of **geospatial storytelling** inspired by the Beryl project.

Each mini-project has to stay **manageable**, with a clear scope and be **reusable** in my other projects.

---

## 7. Organisation & prioritisation

To avoid going in all directions, I stick to a simple logic:

### Short term (0–3 months)

- Stabilise PascheK-ChatBox.  
- Improve homelab documentation.  
- Write this kind of post (technical blog / roadmap).

### Medium term (3–9 months)

- Push m3ntha to a product-level MVP.  
- Publish 1–2 open-source mini-projects.  

### Long term (9+ months)

- Expand m3ntha (more advanced editor, stronger deployment story).  
- Further industrialise the infra (monitoring, stronger IaC).

The internship abroad plugs into this timeline on top (see next section).

---

## 8. Internship abroad: a piece of the roadmap

Alongside these projects, I’m also preparing a **professional internship abroad**, as a continuation of my vocational maturity.

The idea isn’t just “to go somewhere else”, but to:

- test my dev skills in a **different cultural and technical context**;
- work on real projects in my field (ideally web, data, or internal tools);
- **improve a language** in real-life conditions (English, maybe another);
- come back with a broader vision for my own projects (m3ntha, PascheK-ChatBox, infra, etc.).

Programmes like **NextStep** (internships outside Europe), supported by cantons / Movetia, offer exactly that kind of framework:  
a **3 to 6-month full-time internship in your field of training after the vocational baccalaureate**, with guidance and financial support for mobility. [NextStep](https://www.fr.ch/formation-et-ecoles/formation-professionnelle/stages-en-suisse-et-a-letranger)

### 8.1. How it fits with my projects

I see this internship as a **natural extension** of what I’m already building:

- PascheK-ChatBox and m3ntha are my **technical showpieces** in the application.
- My homelab and my mandates (Jeunesse, Giron, UN) show that I can work on systems that run “for real”.
- The internship adds:
  - an international context,
  - different team and organisation constraints,
  - a fresh perspective on my practices (code reviews, processes, etc.).

### 8.2. Risks / realities

An internship abroad also means:

- **time** (3–6 months during or after the end of my training),
- administrative effort (application, language, sometimes visa),
- a temporary shift in some personal project timelines.

But that shift isn’t a loss: it’s more like a **creative pause**. I’d rather see the internship as a direct investment in the quality of what I’ll build afterwards.

---

## 9. Overall risks & realities

All of this still has to fit **real life**:

- There are studies, work, mandates (UN, Jeunesse, Giron…).  
- An internship abroad might push back some dates, but massively enrich the content.  
- Some projects will move forward in “spikes”, others will sleep for a few months.  

That’s normal.  
The important part is **not feeling guilty** if everything doesn’t progress at the same pace, as long as the overall direction stays coherent.

## 10. What I want this blog to show

With this post, I want someone who lands on my portfolio to understand that:

- my personal projects are not “just demos”, but a **thought-through progression**;
- I think about the **value** of what I code (tool, product, learning, international experience);
- I know how to define a **realistic roadmap**, even for my own ideas.
