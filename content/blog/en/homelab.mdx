> This post documents my homelab: a Dell R730 that hosts several services (Nextcloud, WordPress, databases, …) behind a Docker reverse proxy. The idea is both to learn DevOps and to run an infrastructure that I’m fully responsible for.

## 1. Why build a homelab?

I wanted an environment that would let me:

- **understand how apps actually run** (networking, volumes, logs, updates),
- test full stacks (web + database + proxy) without relying on a cloud provider,
- host real services for my projects (Jeunesse, Giron, personal projects),
- train on **DevOps / SRE reflexes**: monitoring, backups, security.

The homelab has become my **serious sandbox**: it’s not a “mission-critical” production environment, but it runs 24/7 and serves useful things.

---

## 2. Hardware & OS

- **Server**: Dell PowerEdge R730  
- **Role**: main homelab machine (compute + storage)  
- **OS**: Ubuntu Server  
- **Virtualisation / containers**: Docker + Docker Compose  

The goal isn’t to stack 15 hypervisors, but to have a simple, controlled base: **one Linux host + clear Docker stacks**.

---

## 3. Docker stack & services

My homelab is organised into several logical **Docker stacks**, all tied together by an internal network and a front-facing reverse proxy.

### 3.1. Reverse proxy

At the edge, a reverse proxy handles:

- **vhosts** (domains / subdomains),
- **HTTPS** termination (Let’s Encrypt certificates),
- routing to the right containers (WordPress, Nextcloud, internal tools).

Concretely, it lets me reach my services with clean URLs like:

- `https://cloud.mydomain.ch`
- `https://giron2026.ch`
- `https://tools.mydomain.ch`

…without having to remember IPs and ports.

### 3.2. Nextcloud

A **Nextcloud** container acts as a hub for:

- project documents (Jeunesse, Giron, UN, school),
- files shared with committees,
- storage for backups or exports.

Typical stack:

- `nextcloud` (PHP + app),
- `db_nextcloud` (MariaDB),
- optionally Redis for caching,
- persistent volumes mounted on the server.

### 3.3. WordPress site

For some projects (like the Giron de Porsel 2026), I host **WordPress** in Docker:

- `wordpress + mariadb` stack,
- Astra Pro + Elementor theme on the content side,
- cache + media optimisation.

The reverse proxy exposes the site securely on the public domain.

### 3.4. Databases & internal services

On top of Nextcloud and WordPress, the homelab hosts:

- **MariaDB / PostgreSQL** databases dedicated to specific projects,
- internal tools (for example, monitoring / SQL admin),
- “utility” containers (tests, scripts, jobs).

Each service has:

- its own internal **network**,
- mounted **volumes**,
- environment variables managed cleanly.

---

## 4. Stack & network organisation

I group my Docker stacks by “functional domain”:

- `reverse-proxy`  
- `cloud` (Nextcloud + DB)  
- `web` (WordPress + related sites)  
- `db` (shared / internal databases)  

Principles:

- One **Docker network per stack**, plus a shared **“proxy” network**.
- Sensitive services (DB, admin tools) are **never exposed directly** to the internet.
- Only the reverse proxy listens on ports 80/443 on the host.

This separation reduces the risk of mistakes (like exposing a DB by accident).

---

## 5. Security & best practices

A few rules I follow by default:

- Regular updates of the OS and Docker images.
- No public ports open except 80/443 (and possibly restricted SSH).
- Strong passwords + secret management in separate files or a dedicated tool.
- Basic logs accessible via `docker logs` + files on the host.
- Access to internal services only via VPN or local network.

The idea isn’t to be “paranoid”, but to start from the assumption that **any exposed service will be scanned** sooner or later.

---

## 6. Backups & resilience

I’m progressively structuring backups:

- regular database exports (SQL dumps),
- snapshots of critical volumes (Nextcloud, WordPress),
- synchronisation to another storage location (NAS / encrypted cloud).

The goal is to be able to **recreate a stack** from docs + backups without spending days on it.

---

## 7. What the homelab brings me

Beyond the “geek” aspect, the homelab forces me to:

- think like an **operator**, not just a developer,
- understand the network layers (DNS, proxy, SSL, ports),
- care about **security** and failures,
- document what I do so I can replay it later.

These are skills that translate directly:

- to my client projects (Jeunesse, Giron, UN),
- to my personal projects (m3ntha, PascheK-ChatBox),
- and to a future **internship abroad** or a DevOps / full-stack position.

---

## 8. Roadmap for what’s next

Next steps for my homelab:

- Add **monitoring** (Netdata, Prometheus / Grafana) to track the server’s health.
- Introduce more **infra as code** (versioned scripts and config files).
- Automate backups and restore tests further.
- Document everything like a real client project (diagrams, README, playbooks).

---

My homelab isn’t perfect, but it’s **alive**: I learn things there that I would never see with a simple “one-click” cloud deployment. And that’s exactly what I was looking for.
