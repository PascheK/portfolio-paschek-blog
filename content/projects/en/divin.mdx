## Overview

**Div-In** is a community mobile application dedicated to the world of diving.  
It allows users to manage their dives, track their progress, share information and, eventually, connect divers and dive centres.

I contribute to the project as a **supporting full-stack developer**, mainly on:

- implementing **small targeted features** in **React Native** and on the **Laravel backend**,
- **bug fixing** and improving the user experience,
- **writing and structuring technical documentation** to clarify how the app works.

## Features I contributed to

Even though I’m not the main developer on the project, I’ve made concrete contributions across several areas:

- **React Native screens & flows**
  - Adjustments to existing screens (forms, lists, navigation).
  - Adding or updating reusable UI components.
  - Fixing behaviours (validation, error messages, loading states).

- **API integration / Laravel backend**
  - Connecting to new endpoints or adapting existing calls.
  - Handling responses and errors on the mobile side.
  - Aligning app models with the API’s JSON structures.

- **UX improvements**
  - Clearer feedback for statuses (loading, success, error).
  - Refining texts, labels and error messages to guide users.
  - Small navigation improvements (back flows, transitions, visual feedback).

- **Technical documentation**
  - Writing **structured docs** about:
    - the global architecture (React Native ↔ Laravel ↔ database),
    - key screens and flows,
    - the API endpoints used,
    - important business rules.
  - Goal: make it easier for other developers to onboard the project.

## Role & Contribution

I am **not the lead developer** on Div-In, but I act as a **supporting developer** on:

- implementing **targeted features** (mobile + backend),
- **fixing bugs** on existing screens,
- improving **usability** and user feedback,
- writing **clear, structured technical documentation**.

In short, my role is to:

- **stabilise** parts of the app,
- **smooth out** the UX through small, focused adjustments,
- **clarify** how everything works through documentation.
