#  Giron de Porsel 2026 – Infrastructure & Internal Tools

As part of organising the **Giron de Porsel 2026**, I designed and currently maintain the event’s entire digital infrastructure.  
This infrastructure is hosted on my **Dell PowerEdge R730** server, running Linux, with a **fully isolated Docker stack**.

The goal: provide robust, secure and accessible services to the various members of the organising committee.

---

#  Project 1 – Self-hosted Infrastructure (Dell R730 Server)

###  Goals
- Centralise all Giron services on a single reliable server  
- Secure both public and internal access  
- Provide a stable environment for WordPress, Nextcloud and the database  

###  Main configuration
- **OS: Ubuntu Server**  
- **Virtualisation: Docker + docker-compose**  
- **Reverse proxy: Nginx Proxy Manager or Traefik**  
- **HTTPS certificates: Let’s Encrypt / Certbot**  
- **Monitoring: logs + container-level monitoring**  

###  Security & networking
- Isolation via **Docker networks**
- Strict firewall rules (only ports 80/443 open)
- Internal subnet for sensitive services (DB, Nextcloud)
- Regular snapshot backups + DB exports

---

#  Project 2 – Official WordPress Site

The Giron 2026 website is built on a modern WordPress stack, hosted inside a dedicated container.

###  Stack
- **WordPress (Docker)**  
- **Astra Pro theme**  
- **Page builder: Elementor Pro**  
- **Plugins: SEO, security, cache, forms**  

###  Site features
- Dynamic home page  
- Presentation of the commissions  
- News & posts  
- Practical info (tickets, schedule, activities)  
- Layout faithful to the provided mockup  
- Performance optimised (cache + compression + local CDN-style config)  

###  Simplified CI/CD
- Deployment via `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`  
- Automatic backups of WordPress volumes  

---

# ☁ Project 3 – Nextcloud (Documents & Internal Organisation)

Nextcloud is used to centralise:  
- official documents,  
- commission files,  
- visuals, mockups and assets,  
- accounting exports,  
- internal coordination.

###  Enabled features
- Secure sharing between committee members  
- Permission management per commission  
- Automatic versioning  
- Media storage + previews  
- Collabora Online for collaborative editing  

###  Nextcloud stack
- Nextcloud Docker container  
- Dedicated database (MariaDB / PostgreSQL)  
- Redis to optimise caching  
- Behind the reverse proxy + SSL  

---

#  Project 4 – Internal Database

###  Usage
- Storage for WordPress data  
- Nextcloud metadata  
- Future internal tools (e.g. registrations, volunteers, sponsorship)  

###  Stack
- MariaDB (Docker)  
- Persistent volumes on SSD  
- Automated backups (cron + compressed dumps)  

###  Strengths
- Access restricted to the internal Docker network  
- Full isolation from public-facing services  
- Fast recovery in case of corruption  

---

#  Project 5 – Reverse Proxy & Network

###  Goal
Provide HTTPS access to all services (site, cloud, internal tools) while securing entry points.

### Configuration
- Reverse proxy using:  
  - **Traefik** *or* **Nginx Proxy Manager**  
- Automatic certificates via Let’s Encrypt  
- HTTPS redirections + security rules  
- HSTS, compression, anti-scan, logs  

### Typical DNS entries
- `giron2026.ch` → WordPress  
- `cloud.giron2026.ch` → Nextcloud  
- `admin.giron2026.ch` → internal tools  

---
